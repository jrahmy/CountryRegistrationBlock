Country Registration Block
==========================
This add-on allows administrators to block countries from registering.

GeoIP headers supplying the visitor's country code must be available. The exact
header name to use is configurable. For CloudFlare-enabled websites, this would
be `HTTP_CF_IPCOUNTRY`
